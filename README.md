## SMS Spam Detection
# It's still on development.

This project aims to detect spam messages in SMS (Short Message Service) using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam (ham). We build and evaluate several machine learning models to classify incoming messages as either spam or ham.

### Overview

<b>Data Selection</b>: We utilize a dataset consisting of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare it for model training.

<b>Model Building</b>: We implement various machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to build models for spam detection.

<b>Model Evaluation</b>: The performance of each model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, visualizations are provided to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
